We Take The For Loop from 1 to x-1
then we take the cube of 'i' "for variable" then subtract it from x and see if it is perfect square or not.
and if it is perfect square print it out.

example if we have a input 12:
then for loop starts , 
i=1
i**3 = 1
then 12-1 =11 not a perfect square then dont print
then 12 - 2***3 = 4 which is perfect square . then print it out . done thats it !
